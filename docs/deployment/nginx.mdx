Though Casdoor follows a front-end back-end separation architecture, in a production environment, the back-end program still provides static file services for front-end files. Hence, you can employ reverse proxy software like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) to proxy all traffic for the Casdoor domain and redirect it to the port monitored by the backend Go program.

In this chapter, you will learn how to use Nginx to reverse proxy your backend Go program and quickly start the Casdoor service.

## 1. Build front end static files

Assuming you have downloaded Casdoor and completed the necessary configuration (if not, refer to the **Get started** section), you only need to build the static files as follows:

````mdx-code-block

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn install && yarn run build
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

````

## 2. Run the back-end program

```sh
go run main.go
```

Or, build it first:

```sh
go build && ./main
```

## 3. Configure and run Nginx

```bash
vim /path/to/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Then, add a server:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME;
    location / {
        proxy_set_header    Host            $http_host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_redirect      off;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
}
```

Next, restart your Nginx process. Run:

```bash
nginx -s reload
```

## 4. Test

Visit `http://YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME` in your favorite browser.
