In the Spring Cloud microservice system, general authentication occurs at the gateway. Please refer to [casdoor-springcloud-gateway-example](/docs/integration/java/spring-cloud-gateway) for more information.

If you want to use Casdoor in a single service, you can refer to [casdoor-spring-boot-example](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor-spring-boot-example).

Whether it's in the gateway layer or in a single service, both use the [casdoor-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor-spring-boot-starter).
