Casdoor can be used as a subscription management system through its `Plan`, `Pricing`, and `Subscription` features.

You can choose which plans to include in your price list, as shown in the pictures below:

Each `Pricing` belongs to a specific `Application`. Users can select a plan and sign up as a `paid-user` through the corresponding `pricing page URL` of the `Pricing`.

## General flow

The general flow looks like this:

1. Users enter the select-plan page of the `Pricing` by accessing the `pricing page URL` shared by the admin.

2. Users select a `Plan` to subscribe and complete the signup process, becoming a `paid-user`.

3. After signing up, users will be redirected to the buy-plan page for the selected `Plan` to proceed with the payment.

4. Once the payment is successfully completed, the user's `Subscription` for the `Plan` is activated. Now, users can log in to Casdoor as a `paid-user`.
