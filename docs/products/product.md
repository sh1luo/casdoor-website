## Payment Provider

In addition to setting these properties, you also need to add payment providers to the product.
Multiple payment providers can be added to a product.

To learn how to configure a payment provider, refer to [Payment Provider](/docs/provider/payment/overview)

Finally, fill in the **Return URL**. This is the URL to which the payment provider page will redirect after the payment is completed.
