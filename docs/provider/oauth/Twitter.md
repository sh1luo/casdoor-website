## Twitter (Work in Progress ðŸš§)

> Applying for a developer account on Twitter can be a bit cumbersome due to the strict official restrictions. It may be more challenging compared to other third-party platforms.

To get started, visit the [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and create an account if you don't have one. Twitter requires you to provide detailed information about your application for a developer account. Make sure to fill in the information accurately to avoid any issues during the review process.

Once your application is approved, you can proceed to create an application. You need to complete two important tasks in the **Authentication settings** section:

1. Manually enable **3-legged OAuth**. This is necessary for features such as "Sign in with Twitter" and posting Tweets on behalf of other accounts.
2. Enable **Request email address from users** to obtain the user's email address.

Make sure to carefully fill in the callback address and other required information for your application.
