## Step 1. Preparation

First, you need to have a merchant account at [WeChat Merchant Platform](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/index.php/public/wechatpay_en).

Before accessing the WeChat Pay, there are some preparations that need to be done.

You can refer to the documentation [preparation before access](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/docs/merchant/products/native-payment/preparation.html) for more information.

### 1.1 Get API Key v3

Log in to WeChat Merchant Platform, select `Account Settings > API Security >Set APIv3 Secret`, and click `Set APIv3 secret` to get the `API Key v3`.

After download the certificate, get the `Certificate Serial Number` according to [How to view the Certificate Serial Number](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wiki/doc/apiv3/wechatpay/wechatpay7_0.shtml#part-5) and `Private Key` according to [How to get Private Key of Certificate](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/wiki/doc/apiv3/wechatpay/wechatpay3_1.shtml).

Then, create a `Cert` at Casdoor and fill the necessary information.

## Support for JSAPI payment

Currently, Casdoor supports [JSAPI payment](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/docs/merchant/products/jsapi-payment/introduction.html) and [Native payment](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/docs/merchant/products/native-payment/introduction.html) in WeChat Pay.

To support JSAPI payment, you should configure a [WeChat OAuth Provider](/docs/provider/oauth/Wechat) which support `WeChat Media Platform`.
The `Client ID 2` of WeChat OAuth Provider and the `App ID` of WeChat Pay Payment Provider need to be same.

After log in via WeChat(in the mobile scenario: e.g. the WeChat built-in browser inside the WeChat mobile app), users can purchase product using WeChat Pay based on JSAPI payment.
