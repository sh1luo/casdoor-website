You can upload resources in Casdoor. Before uploading resources, you need to configure a storage provider.
Please refer to the [Storage Provider](/docs/provider/storage/overview) section for more information.

Once you have configured at least one **storage provider** and added it to your **application**, you can proceed.

Great! Now let's take a look at an example of how to **upload** and **delete** resources.

### Uploading Resources

Users can upload various types of resources, such as files and images, to the [cloud storage](/docs/provider/storage/overview) that you have configured.
