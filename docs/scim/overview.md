The SCIM protocol is a HTTP-based protocol for provisioning and managing identity data specified through SCIM schemas.
You can use Casdoor as a SCIM service provider.

## Use Casdoor as SCIM service provider

Currently Casdoor only support `User Resource Schema`, you can manage users through SCIM User operations.
You can interact with the Casdoor through the following endpoints:

| Endpoint          | Method  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| /scim/ServiceProviderConfig | GET | Provide details about the features of the SCIM standard that are supported, for example, the resources that are supported. |
| /scim/Schemas | GET | Provide details about the service provider schemas. |
| /scim/ResourceTypes | GET | Specifie metadata about each resource. |
| /scim/Users/:id | GET | Retrieve a user with resource identifier `id`. |
| /scim/Users | GET | Query users with query parameters (currently only support `startIndex` and `count`). |
| /scim/Users | POST | Create a user. |
| /scim/Users/:id | PUT | Update a user with resource identifier `id`. |
| /scim/Users/:id | PATCH | Modify a user with resource identifier `id` by PATCH operation. |
| /scim/Users/:id | DEL | Delete a user with resource identifier `id`. |

For more details, please refer to [rfc7644](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644).

## User Resource

Casdoor implements the mapping between `User Resource Schema` (SCIM) and `User` (Casdoor).
The mapping relationship between attributes is as follows:

| User Resource Schema (SCIM)          | User (Casdoor)  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| id | Id |
| meta.created | CreatedTime |
| meta.lastModified | UpdatedTime |
| meta.version | UpdatedTime |
| externalId | ExternalId |
| userName | Name |
| password | Password |
| displayName | DisplayName |
| profileUrl | Homepage |
| userType | Type |
| name.givenName | FirstName |
| name.familyName | LastName |
| emails[0].value | Email |
| phoneNumbers[0].value | Phone |
| photos[0].value | Avatar |
| addresses[0].locality | Location |
| addresses[0].region | Region |
| addresses[0].country | CountryCode |

Since Casdoor use Organization to manage User, where each User belongs to a specific Organization, the `organization` attribute should be passed in `Enterprise User Schema Extension` (identified by the schema URI `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User`). Here is a User Resource Schema SCIM representation in JSON format:

```json
